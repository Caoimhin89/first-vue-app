    <div id="lesson2">
      <button v-on:click="increase(2, $event)">Click me to watch the counter go up by two!</button>
      <p>This is accomplished by passing 2 as an argument with the click event.</p>
      <p>{{ counter }}</p>

      <h3>Move your mouse around on the line with the sentence below to watch your mouse cursor's
        x and y coordinates get updated.</h3>
      <p v-on:mousemove="updateCoordinates">This is accomplished by fetching the coordinates and using those
        values to update the values of our x and y variables in our javascript file, then updating the view
        with those values through interpolation every time the user moves the mouse inside the p element.
        <span v-on:mousemove.stop="">| NO UPDATES IN THIS SPACE THANKS TO EVENT MODIFIERS! (In this case, .stop)
          |</span> Within span tags, the directive v-on:mousemove is bound and modified with .stop to prevent
        the event from being propogated to the containing p element. That's why your mouse's coordinates won't
        be updated when your cursor passes through that part of the paragraph.</p>
      <p>Coordinates: {{ x }} / {{ y }}</p>

      <h3>Type something into the text input field and press enter!</h3>
      <input type="text" v-on:keyup.enter="alertMe">
      <p>You will see an alert displayed when you hit enter. This is done by grabbing the keyboard's keyup
        event with a modifier to make sure we're only firing off the event when the user presses enter.</p>
